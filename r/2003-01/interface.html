  <h2>Notes about the S-Plus user interface</h2>
  <p class="indent">There are two different ways to work in S-Plus:
  <ul>
    <li>Using the mouse to select menu commands in the graphical user interface
      (GUI)
    <li>Typing the commands as text in a window called the command line
  </ul>
  <p class="indent">The GUI is easy to learn and gives a quick overview of the
  capabilities of the S language, but many important functions are only found in
  the command line.
  <h2>The fear factor</h2>
  <p class="indent">Most people are used to working with a mouse and menus when
  they use a computer at work and feel less comfortable faced with a screen
  showing only text and numbers. Some experience in programming with data (like
  writing a macro in MS Excel) helps overcome this fear and opens up an
  essential part of S-Plus, the ability to write additional functions.

  <h2>Command line</h2>
  <p class="indent">Many tasks are actually easier to do in the command line
  than in the GUI, using simple but powerful commands such as
  <code>plot(x,y)</code> to create a scatterplot and <code>lm(y~x)</code> to fit
  a linear regression model. Basic data manipulation, like multiplying two
  columns, is straightforward from the command line, <code>x*y</code>, but
  virtually impossible in the GUI. Using the command line is also the only way
  to write additional functions, as a shorthand for frequently needed
  computations or to automate complicated tasks.

  <h2>What about R?</h2>
  <p class="indent">S-Plus and R are two different programs that use the S
  language for commands, with only slightly different dialects. They're
  identical 99% of the time, but the differences arise mainly in esoteric issues
  like calling the operating system to get some information about files or
  interact with other programs. The developers of R insist that S code should
  look the same in Windows, Unix, and Macintosh.
  <p class="indent">Although S-Plus and R are comparable in syntax and speed,
  there are two important differences for the user: R is free, but includes only
  the command line interface. Students are offered S-Plus without payment for a
  12 month period, but many command line users prefer R because of its
  transparent and powerful architecture. Due to the growing R user community,
  its development is now outpacing S-Plus. See
