  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p class="indent">A choreographed GUI introductory session with a prepared
  dataset:
  <ul>
    <li>Import the dataset
    <li>Summarize the data
    <li>Fit a linear regression model
    <li>Graph the model fit
    <li>Export the graph into MS Word
  </ul>
  <p class="indent">Having done this, we will repeat the same tasks using the
  command line.

  <h2>Basic statistics</h2>
  <p class="indent">Overview of statistical analyses in the GUI, perform a
  couple of classical tests of significance and fit some regression models.
  Repeat in the command line.

  <h2>Linear models</h2>
  <p class="indent">Linear models (Anova, LM, GLM) in detail, mainly in the
  command line which offers a suite of helping functions for linear modelling.
  Local regression (Loess) will also be covered in this session.

  <h2>Graphics</h2>
  <p class="indent">Overview of plots in the GUI, create a few different plots
  including multi-panel with marginal labels. Repeat in the command line, which
  offers a large number of plot arguments to arrange and overlay graphs. Devices
  to export graphics to various file formats will also be covered in this
  session.

  <h2>Data manipulation</h2>
  <p class="indent">Introduction to some of the fundamental aspects of the S
  language:
  <ul>
    <li>Overview of available help (built-in, manuals, books)
    <li>Data objects and manipulation (vectors, matrices, lists, data frames)
    <li>Importing and exporting data in various formats (text, Excel, Access)
    <li>Managing multiple projects (organizing your work in S-Plus)
  </ul>

  <h2>Programming</h2>
  <p class="indent">Introduction to S programming, implementing a generalized
  function that automates the tasks from the first session. A brief comparison
  of S-Plus and R will also be covered in this session.
